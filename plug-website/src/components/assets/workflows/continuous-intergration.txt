Continuous integration workflow

This workflow is implemented on a pull request to the main branch:
	on:
	  pull_request:
	    branches: [ main ]
	    
The workflow jobs run on the latest version of ubuntu linux:
	jobs:
	  build:
	    name: Build and Run Unit Tests
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    
The workflow does a clean install of node dependencies using [ npm ci ] command, then builds the source code using [ npm run build:release --if-present ] command and runs tests across different versions of node as specified in the continuous-integration.yml file in .github/workflows
