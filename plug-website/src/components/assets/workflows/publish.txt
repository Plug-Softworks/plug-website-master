Publish and deploy workflow

The workflow is implemented on a new release:
	on:
	  release:
	    types: [published]
	    
The workflow jobs run on the latest version of ubuntu:

	jobs:
	  publish-and-deploy-documentation:
	    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
	    
The first step is implementing a checkout action using [ actions/checkout@v2 ], which brings the source code into the current working directory.

Then a node environment --version: 16 is set up:
	uses: actions/setup-node@v1
	with:
	  node-version: 16
	  registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
	  
Then the dependencies are installed [ npm install ], building is done [ npm run build ] and published to npm with the --access public flag [ npm publish --access public ]:

      - name: NPM Install
        run: npm install
      - name: NPM run build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Publish to NPM
        run: npm publish --access public
